### Instructions: String Manipulation Challenge in Python

- Define a variable named `sample_string` and assign it the following value:
    - The Return of the Jedi  

- Find the index of the first occurrence of the lowercase letter "t"  

- Convert the sample string to uppercase  

- Replace "Jedi" with "Terminator" or "Gladiator"  

- Extract and print the first three characters of the string (by using string slicing/string indexing)

    - See [Slicing Strings in Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings_slicing.asp) on the w3schools.com website

- Check if the sample string ends with the lowercase letter "e" (the most frequently occuring letter in the English langauge)
    - use the Python [`endswith()`](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_endswith.asp) method to do this


### Extension

- Create your own string manipulation challenge for your classmates to solve  

- Use any three (3) of the string manipulation methods discussed in the YouTube video below  

    - Bro Code: [String Methods in Python Are Easy](https://youtu.be/tb6EYiHtcXU?feature=shared)  

    - NOTE: The **length function** -- `len( )` -- is not a string method, but you can use it in your extension project if you wish, since it's often used when working with Python strings
